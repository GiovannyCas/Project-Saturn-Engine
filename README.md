# Saturn Engine

# A Graphics engine in C++ with DirectX API and ImGui

As a personal project, I have been developing a game engine using C++ and DirectX. This hobbyist endeavor allows me to delve deep into graphics programming, system architecture, and real-time rendering techniques. By leveraging DirectX as my API, I focus on optimizing performance and achieving high-quality visual effects, enhancing my skills in game engine design and development.

* Developed a lightweight graphics viewer/editor with an emphasis on efficiency and user-friendliness.
* Designed based on the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) architecture to seamlessly integrate and optimize the engine's functionality.
* Implemented cutting-edge systems and features, enabling real-time rendering of 3D objects.
* Designed and implemented a user interface with ImGui to facilitate seamless interaction with the environment.

Here is a preview of the graphic engine v0.1:

# Update:
I'm continuing this project to develop new features that include;

* new multi-scene system
* A skydome
* UI improvement
* and develop a new basic framework for game development.

This project is dependent on Visual Studio 2022 IDE with DirectX API
