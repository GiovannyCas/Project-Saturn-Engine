# Saturn Engine

# A Graphics engine in C++ with DirectX API 

This is a hobby project to test my skills and learn Computer Graphics programming. From researching the intricacies of the DirectX framework to grasping the nuances of the graphics pipeline and shader programming.

* Developed a lightweight graphics viewer/editor with an emphasis on efficiency and user-friendliness.
* Designed based on the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) architecture to seamlessly integrate and optimize the engine's functionality.
* Implemented cutting-edge systems and features, enabling real-time rendering of 3D objects.

Here is a preview of the graphic engine:
